This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### User Stories

A user will be able to save stocks to a watchlist to track
A user will be able to save charts related to specific stocks/equities with the technical indicators they selected (maybe add notes feature)
A user will be able to make predictions on the price future price movements of stocks and be awarded points depending on how close they were and how long the time frame was.

A user can have many watchlists and delete the stocks inside them or the list itself
A user will be able to use a fully-deatured stock charting platform where they can see price updates in real time and add technical indicators as they see fit.

A user can have many watchlists and watchlists can have many stocks through W-record (every user starts with a non-deleteable empty default watchlists)
Stocks can have many watchlists through w-record

A user can have many predictions. A prediction belongs to a user

A user can have many charts. A Chart belongs to a User

# USER - CHART - PREDICTION - STOCK - WATCHLIST - W_RECORD(join table)

# Stretch Goals:

I want a text/email to be sent to a user on the date of their prediction expiration date with their results
